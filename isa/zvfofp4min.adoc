== OFP4 conversion extension *Zvfofp4min*, Version 0.1

The Zvfofp4min extension provides basic support for the OFP4 format.
Zvfofp4min requires the Zve32f extension.

The Zvfofp4min extension adds one new instruction, `vfext.vf2`, which is
defined only for SEW=8, `altfmt`=0, and LMUL {ge} 1/4.
This instruction converts a vector of OFP4 values in `vs2` (with EEW=4 and
EMUL=LMUL/2) to a vector of OFP8 E4M3 values in `vd` (with EEW=8 and EMUL=LMUL).
No rounding occurs, and no floating-point exception flags are set.
`vfext.vf2` is encoded in the VXUNARY0 encoding space with `vs1`=10110.

NOTE: It is expected that conversion to only one of the two OFP8 formats is
sufficient, since most commonly the OFP8 result will be consumed by an
operator that supports both OFP8 formats.
Between the two formats, E4M3 is the logical choice because, unlike E5M2, it
is also capable of exactly representing all values in both OFP6 formats.

NOTE: Other floating-point widening conversions have their source EEW equal to
SEW and their destination EEW equal to 2Ã—SEW.
To follow that pattern for conversions from 4-bit types would require `vsew`
to be able to represent SEW=4, which it currently cannot.
Rather than introducing additional SEW encodings and addressing the
definitional challenges of SEW being smaller than one byte, we instead
followed the Vector Integer Extension pattern, in which SEW equals the
destination EEW.

The `vfext.vf2` instruction does not access the `fcsr`, and it is _not_
considered a floating-point instruction for the purposes of the floating-point
context status (FS) settings.

NOTE: This approach simplifies illegal-instruction exception logic, since this
instruction encoded in a minor opcode otherwise only used by integer
instructions.
