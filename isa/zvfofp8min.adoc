== OFP8 conversion extension *Zvfofp8min*, Version 0.2.1

The Zvfofp8min extension provides basic support for the two 8-bit
floating-point formats defined in the
https://www.opencompute.org/documents/ocp-8-bit-floating-point-specification-ofp8-revision-1-0-2023-12-01-pdf-1[Open Compute Project OFP8 specification],
OFP8 E4M3 and OFP8 E5M2.

The Zvfofp8min extension requires the Zve32f extension.

NOTE: In some applications, the OFP8 formats are used to directly represent
numerical values.
In other applications, they are used as components of a block floating-point
format, such as the one described in the
https://www.opencompute.org/documents/ocp-microscaling-formats-mx-v1-0-spec-final-pdf[OCP
Microscaling specification].
The conversion instructions defined in this extension support both use cases.
Software can convert OFP8 values to BF16 or FP32, then apply the scaling factor
in the higher-precision format, using, for example, a `vfmul.vf` instruction.
Future vector or matrix extensions might provide direct support for
microscaling if the need becomes quantitatively demonstrable.

NOTE: Only vector support for the OFP8 formats is currently proposed, as these
formats are used almost exclusively in highly data-parallel computations.

The canonical NaN for both E4M3 and E5M2 is `0x7f`.

=== OFP8 to BF16 conversion instructions

The existing `vfwcvtbf16.f.f.v` instruction is used to convert from the OFP8
formats to BF16.
When SEW=8 and `altfmt`=0, this instruction converts a vector of OFP8 E4M3
values in `vs2` to a vector of BF16 values, writing the result to `vd`.
No rounding occurs, and no floating-point exception flags are set.
When SEW=8 and `altfmt`=1, the instruction instead treats `vs2` as a vector of
OFP8 E5M2 values, but behaves identically otherwise.

NOTE: Conversion to FP32, FP16, and integer formats is accomplished by first
converting to BF16, then using existing instructions in the Zvfbfmin, Zvfbfa,
Zvfhmin, and Zve32f extensions.
Conversion from OFP8 directly to FP32 is not a common operation, as OFP8 values
are typically used as multiplicands.
The multiplication operation can itself widen the result if needed.

NOTE: Conversion between the two OFP8 formats is an uncommon operation, but it
can be accomplished by first converting to BF16, then using one of the
instructions defined in the following section.

=== BF16 to OFP8 conversion instructions

The existing `vfncvtbf16.f.f.w` instruction is used to convert from BF16 to the
OFP8 formats.
When SEW=8 and `altfmt`=0, this instruction converts a vector of BF16 values in
`vs2` to a vector of OFP8 E4M3 values, writing the result to `vd`.
Since E4M3 cannot represent infinity, infinite results are converted to the
canonical NaN.
When SEW=8 and `altfmt`=1, the instruction converts to OFP8 E5M2 instead.
In this case, however, infinite results are representable.
In both cases, results are rounded using the dynamic rounding mode in
the `frm` register, and floating-point exceptions are reported in the `fflags`
register as for other floating-point conversions.

The OFP8 standard additionally defines saturating conversions, in which
infinite results are converted to the maximum-magnitude finite value of the
same sign.
A new instruction, `vfncvtbf16.sat.f.f.w`, implements this operation.
It is defined for SEW=8 and `altfmt`=0, and for SEW=8 and `altfmt`=1,
performing the same function as `vfncvtbf16.f.f.w` except for the saturation
property.
It is encoded like `vfncvtbf16.f.f.w`, but with `vs1`=11111.

NOTE: Conversion from 8-bit integer to OFP8 is accomplished by first converting
to BF16 using instructions in the Zvfbfa extension, then using the instructions
defined in this section.

=== FP32 to OFP8 conversion instructions

A new instruction to convert from FP32 to the OFP8 formats, `vfncvt.f.f.q`, is
added.
When SEW=8 and `altfmt`=0, this instruction converts a vector of FP32 values in
`vs2` (with EMUL=4Ã—LMUL) to a vector of OFP8 E4M3 values, writing the result to
`vd` (with EMUL=LMUL).
Since E4M3 cannot represent infinity, infinite results are converted to the
canonical NaN.
When SEW=8 and `altfmt`=1, the instruction converts to OFP8 E5M2 instead.
In this case, however, infinite results are representable.
In both cases, results are rounded using the dynamic rounding mode in
the `frm` register, and floating-point exceptions are reported in the `fflags`
register as for other floating-point conversions.
`vfncvt.f.f.q` is encoded like `vfncvt.f.f.w`, but with `vs1`=11001.

Another new instruction, `vfncvt.sat.f.f.q`, is defined for SEW=8 and
`altfmt`=0, and for SEW=8 and `altfmt`=1, performing the same function as the
`vfncvt.f.f.q` instruction, but with saturation (i.e. infinite results are
converted to the maximum-magnitude finite value of the same sign).
`vfncvt.sat.f.f.q` is encoded like `vfncvt.f.f.w`, but with `vs1`=11011.

NOTE: An alternative design would have been to first convert from FP32 to BF16,
rounding to odd, then use the instructions defined in the previous section to
convert to OFP8.
However, FP32 to OFP8 conversion is common enough to justify the direct
conversion.

NOTE: Conversion from FP16 and 16-bit integer formats is accomplished by first
converting to FP32 using instructions in the Zvfhmin and Zve32f extensions,
then using the instructions defined in this section.
