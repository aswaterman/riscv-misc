== Additional BF16 vector compute support extension *Zvfbfa*, Version 0.2

The Zvfbfa extension adds more complete BF16 vector compute support.

The Zvfbfa extension requires the Zve32f, Zfbfmin, Zvfbfwma, and Zvfbfmin
extensions.

Zvfbfa adds a 1-bit field, `altfmt`, to the `vtype` CSR in bit position 8.
Attempting to set `altfmt`=1 and SEW >= 32 is reserved.

NOTE: The recommended assembly syntax to set `altfmt`=1 is to append the token
`alt` to the SEW setting, e.g. `vsetvli a0, a1, e16alt, m1, ta, ma`.

NOTE: Implementations should set `vill` in `vtype` when a reserved combination
of `altfmt` and SEW is selected.

When `altfmt`=0, the hart behaves as though Zvfbfa were not implemented.

When `altfmt`=1 and SEW=8, all vector floating-point instructions become
reserved, except for the following, which are redefined to use the BF16
format for any operand that would otherwise have used the FP16 format:

- `vfwcvt.f.x[u].v`
- `vfncvt.x[u].f.w`
- `vfncvt.rtz.x[u].f.w`

When `altfmt`=1 and SEW=16, all vector floating-point instructions become
reserved, except for the following, which are redefined to use the BF16
format for any operand that would otherwise have used the FP16 format:

- `vfadd.v[vf]`
- `vfsub.v[vf]`
- `vfmin.v[vf]`
- `vfmax.v[vf]`
- `vfsgnj.v[vf]` ††
- `vfsgnjn.v[vf]` ††
- `vfsgnjx.v[vf]` ††
- `vfslide1up.vf` ††
- `vfslide1down.vf` ††
- `vfmv.v.f` ††
- `vfmerge.vfm` ††
- `vmfeq.v[vf]`
- `vmfle.v[vf]`
- `vmflt.v[vf]`
- `vmfne.v[vf]`
- `vmfgt.vf`
- `vmfge.vf`
- `vfmul.v[vf]`
- `vfrsub.vf`
- `vfmadd.v[vf]`
- `vfnmadd.v[vf]`
- `vfmsub.v[vf]`
- `vfnmsub.v[vf]`
- `vfmacc.v[vf]`
- `vfnmacc.v[vf]`
- `vfmsac.v[vf]`
- `vfnmsac.v[vf]`
- `vfwadd.v[vf]`
- `vfwsub.v[vf]`
- `vfwadd.w[vf]`
- `vfwsub.w[vf]`
- `vfwmul.v[vf]`
- `vfwmacc.v[vf]` (same semantics as `vfwmaccbf16.v[vf]`)
- `vfwnmacc.v[vf]`
- `vfwmsac.v[vf]`
- `vfwnmsac.v[vf]`
- `vfmv.s.f` ††
- `vfmv.f.s` †
- `vfwcvt.f.f.v` (same semantics as `vfwcvtbf16.f.f.v`)
- `vfncvt.f.f.w` (same semantics as `vfncvtbf16.f.f.w`)
- `vfncvt.rod.f.f.w`
- `vfrsqrt7.v`
- `vfrec7.v`
- `vfclass.v`
- `vfwmaccbf16.v[vf]` †
- `vfwcvtbf16.f.f.v` †
- `vfncvtbf16.f.f.w` †

The instructions marked with † have the same semantics regardless of `altfmt`.
The instructions marked with †† differ only in that improperly NaN-boxed
`f`-register operands must substitute the BF16 canonical NaN instead of the
FP16 canonical NaN.

NOTE: The excluded operations are division, square root, reductions, and
conversions to/from integers wider than 8 bits.
These operations can be performed by converting to and from FP32.

For `vfrec7.v`, some inputs greater than 2^126^ produce subnormal results that
cannot be exactly represented in BF16's limited precision.
These results are rounded towards zero.
